- The question is centered at the top of the game with four options for answers. The Options are styled to be similar to each other and to fit their content. All buttons will display a border when hovered over, on a computer and when clicked, on a tablet. If the user chooses a correct answer the option they clicked will display in a green background color, if the user chooses an incorrect answer that option will display in a red background color.
